## Problem and Solution Summary
Problem: 
1. The HR of Repsol admits that manual resume screening takes a lot of time, slowing down the hiring process.
2. Onboarding processes at Repsol are still manual, leading to inefficiencies and lack of scalability.
3. HR and MD spend significant time personally conducting many interviews, reducing their availability for strategic tasks.

Solution:
1. **Smart Resume Screening (NLP + LLM)**
- Automates resume analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract key insights, highlight strengths/weaknesses, and rank candidates efficiently.
2. **Onboarding Workflow Automation + RAG-Powered AI Chatbot**
- Streamlines onboarding with drag-and-drop workflow automation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based AI chatbot to provide accurate, instant responses to new hires.
3. **AI-Assisted Interview with Human Oversight**
Conducts structured, AI-driven interviews that save HR/MD time while ensuring human review/validation of the interview content, improving efficiency without compromising quality.
